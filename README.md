# Option Pricing Models in Python

A Python project implementing two fundamental models in financial derivatives pricing:

- **Black-Scholes Model** for European options using closed-form solutions
- **One-step Binomial Tree Model** for flexible option pricing under discrete time

This project is part of my self-learning and academic exploration of quantitative finance and Python development. It also serves as a foundational step toward building more advanced pricing and risk management tools.
